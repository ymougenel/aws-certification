# 📌 AWS Lambda – Revision Card

## 📝 Introduction
AWS Lambda is a **serverless compute service** that runs code without provisioning or managing servers.

### ✅ Key Principles
1. **Event-driven execution** – Runs code in response to events (S3, API Gateway, DynamoDB, etc.).
2. **Fully managed infrastructure** – No server management, scales automatically.
3. **Pay-per-use** – Billed by execution time and resources consumed.

---

## 🚀 Advantages
- **Serverless**: No servers to manage.
- **On-demand execution**: Code runs only when scheduled or triggered.
- **Automatic scaling**: Instantly scales with workload.

---

## ⏳ Limits per Region
- **Execution time**: Up to **15 minutes** per function.
- **Memory allocation**: From **128 MB to 10 GB**.
- **Concurrency executions**: Default **1,000+ concurrent executions** per account (can be increased).
- **Notes**: Cold start issues may occur for some runtimes.

---

## ⚡ Features
- **Lambda SnapStart**: Reduces cold start latency for Java functions by initializing and caching execution environments.
- **Environment variables** for configuration.
- **Layers** to share code across functions.

## 🌍 Lambda@Edge vs CloudFront Functions
| Feature              | Lambda@Edge | CloudFront Functions |
|----------------------|-------------|-----------------------|
| Execution location   | Edge locations | Edge locations |
| Runtime              | Node.js, Python | Lightweight JS only |
| Max execution time   | ~5 seconds | <1 ms |
| Use cases            | Complex request/response manipulation (auth, headers, rewrites) | Simple header manipulation, redirects, caching logic |
| Cost                 | Higher | Lower |

## 🔗 Lambda with VPC & Proxy
- By default, Lambda runs **outside your VPC**.
- To access **private resources (RDS, EC2, ElastiCache)** → attach Lambda to a VPC (requires ENIs, increases cold start time).
- Can act as a **proxy** via API Gateway.

---

## 📊 Integrations
- **CloudWatch**:
    - Logs function output automatically.
    - Metrics on invocations, errors, duration, concurrency.
- **CloudTrail**: Audit API calls.
- **X-Ray**: Trace function performance.

---

## 💻 Compatible Runtimes
- Supported languages: **Python, Node.js, Java, Go, Ruby, .NET, PowerShell**.
- **Custom runtimes** supported via Runtime API.
- **Lambda container images**: Deploy using Docker images (up to 10 GB).
