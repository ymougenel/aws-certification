# 📌 Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) – Revision Card

## 📝 Introduction
Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) provides **resizable compute capacity** in the AWS cloud.

### ✅ Key Principles
1. **Virtual servers in the cloud** – Instances launched with chosen CPU, memory, and storage.
2. **Scalable & elastic** – Easily scale up/down using Auto Scaling and Load Balancing.
3. **Integrated with AWS ecosystem** – Works with EBS, IAM, VPC, CloudWatch, etc.

## 💻 Instance Types
Different families optimized for specific workloads:

- **t (T3, T4g)** – Burstable general purpose (low-cost dev/test).
- **m (M6i, M7g)** – General purpose (balanced CPU/Mem).
- **c (C6g, C7i)** – Compute-optimized (high CPU).
- **r (R6i)** – Memory-optimized (DBs, in-memory caches).
- **i (I4i)** – Storage-optimized (high IOPS, NoSQL).
- **g / p / inf** – GPU/ML/AI acceleration.
- **x / z** – High memory for SAP HANA, analytics.
- **d / h** – HDD-based, high storage throughput.

## 💰 Purchasing Options
- **On-Demand** – Pay per second/minute, no commitment. Best for short-term, unpredictable workloads.
- **Reserved Instances (RI)** – Up to 72% discount for 1–3 year commitment.
- **Savings Plans** – Flexible pricing commitment ($/hour over 1–3 years).
- **Spot Instances** – Up to 90% discount, can be interrupted. Good for batch jobs, stateless apps.
- **Dedicated Hosts / Dedicated Instances** – Physical server dedicated to a single customer (compliance/licensing).
- **Capacity Reservations** – Reserve capacity in a specific AZ.

---

## 🏗️ Placement Groups
Control placement of EC2 instances within AWS infrastructure:

- **Cluster** – Instances close together in one AZ.  
  → High throughput, low latency (HPC, big data).
- **Spread** – Instances spread across racks, each with separate power/network.  
  → High availability, resilience to hardware failures.
- **Partition** – Instances divided into logical groups, each group isolated.  
  → Useful for distributed systems like Hadoop, Cassandra.

## 🌐 ENI (Elastic Network Interfaces)
- A **virtual network card** for EC2 instances.
- Can attach multiple ENIs to an instance.
- Each ENI has:
    - Primary private IP address (mandatory).
    - Secondary private IPs.
    - One Elastic IP (optional).
    - Security Groups.
    - MAC address.
- Useful for:
    - High availability network solutions.
    - Management and production networks separation.
    - Network appliances with multiple interfaces.

---

### 🔹 True / False
**Q6.** You can attach multiple ENIs to a single EC2 instance.  
✅ True

**Q7.** Spot instances are recommended for critical production workloads requiring guaranteed availability.  
❌ False

**Q8.** Spread placement groups allow only up to 7 instances per AZ.  
✅ True

**Q9.** A Dedicated Host gives visibility into physical sockets and cores.  
✅ True

**Q10.** EC2 instance store volumes persist even after stopping the instance.  
❌ False (they are ephemeral).
