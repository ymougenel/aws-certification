# 💾 Amazon EBS & EFS – Revision Card

---

## 📦 Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store)

### 📝 Introduction
EBS provides **block storage volumes** for EC2 instances. Persistent, network-attached, and highly available within an AZ.

### ✅ Principles (3 Keypoints)
1. **Persistent block storage** tied to an AZ.  
2. **Durable and resizable volumes** (GP, IO1/IO2, ST1, SC1).  
3. **Can be attached to EC2 instances** for OS, apps, or databases.  

---

### 📸 EBS Snapshot Features
- Point-in-time copy of volumes, stored in **S3** (incremental).  
- Snapshots can be used to:  
  - Create new volumes.  
  - Share across accounts.  
  - Copy across Regions.  
- Automated lifecycle with **Data Lifecycle Manager (DLM)**.  

---

### 💾 Storage Types
- **General Purpose (gp2/gp3)** → Balanced price/performance, SSD.  
- **Provisioned IOPS (io1/io2)** → High-performance SSD, low latency, critical DBs.  
- **Throughput Optimized HDD (st1)** → Streaming, big data, data warehouses.  
- **Cold HDD (sc1)** → Low-cost, infrequent access.  

---

### 🔗 EBS Multi-Attach
- Supported for **io1/io2 volumes**.  
- Allows attachment of the same volume to **multiple EC2 instances** (within same AZ).  
- Use case: clustered applications (databases, file systems).  

---

### 🔐 EBS Encryption
- Encryption at rest using **KMS**.  
- Also supports **in-transit encryption**.  
- Snapshots & volumes created from encrypted EBS are **encrypted by default**.  

---

## 📷 Amazon Machine Image (AMI) Overview
- Template for launching EC2 instances (OS + configuration).  
- Can be **shared across accounts or Regions**.  
- If AMI uses encrypted snapshots → requires KMS key sharing.

## ⚡ EC2 Instance Store

### ✅ Principles (3 Keypoints)
1. **Temporary block storage** physically attached to the host.  
2. Very high performance, but **ephemeral** (lost when instance stops/terminates).  
3. Ideal for **cache, buffer, temporary data**.

### 🔄 Comparison with EBS
| Feature            | EBS                              | Instance Store                  |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| Persistence        | Survives stop/start              | Lost when stopped/terminated    |
| Performance        | High (depends on volume type)    | Very high (directly on host)    |
| Use case           | Databases, OS, persistent data   | Cache, temp files, ephemeral    |
| Backup             | Snapshots to S3 supported        | No snapshots                    |
| AZ Scope           | Tied to a single AZ              | Tied to a specific EC2 instance |

## 📂 Amazon EFS (Elastic File System)
- **Managed network file system (NFS)** for EC2, Lambda, and on-premises servers.  
- **Multi-AZ, scalable, shared storage**.  
- Use cases: **web apps, content management, data sharing**.

B. EFS  
C. Instance Store  
D. S3 Glacier  
✅ **Answer: B**

---

### 🔹 True / False
**Q4.** EBS Snapshots are stored in S3 and incremental.  
✅ True  

**Q5.** Instance Store data persists after instance stop/restart.
