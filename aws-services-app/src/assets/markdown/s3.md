# 📌 Amazon S3 – Revision Card

## 📝 Introduction
Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service) is an **object storage service** that provides scalability, durability, and availability.

### ✅ Key Principles
1. **Objects stored in buckets** – Each object has a unique key (identifier).
2. **Unlimited storage** – Virtually unlimited capacity, up to 5 TB per object.
3. **Durability & availability** – 99.999999999% (11 9’s) durability across multiple AZs.

### 🏷️ Naming Convention
- Globally unique bucket name (DNS-compliant).
- Lowercase letters, numbers, hyphens.
- Must not resemble an IP address.
- Example: `my-app-bucket-001`.

---

## 🔒 Bucket Policies
- JSON-based access control for **permissions at the bucket level**.
- Define **who can access** (IAM users, roles, accounts, public).
- Common use cases:
    - Public read access for static website hosting.
    - Restrict access to VPC endpoints.
    - Enforce **encryption policies**.

---

## 🔁 Replication
- **Cross-Region Replication (CRR):** Replicate objects across AWS Regions.
- **Same-Region Replication (SRR):** Replicate within the same Region (compliance, HA).
- Requirements:
    - Source and destination buckets in different accounts or same account.
    - **Versioning must be enabled.**
- Replication does not apply retroactively (only new objects).

## 🗄️ Storage Classes
Different tiers optimized for cost vs. performance:

| Storage Class        	| Use Case |
|---------------------------|----------|
| **S3 Standard**       	| Frequent access, high availability. |
| **S3 Intelligent-Tiering**| Automatically moves data between access tiers. |
| **S3 Standard-IA**    	| Infrequent access, but still fast retrieval. |
| **S3 One Zone-IA**    	| Infrequent access, stored in a single AZ. |
| **S3 Glacier Instant**	| Millisecond retrieval, archival data. |
| **S3 Glacier Flexible**   | Minutes to hours retrieval, cheaper. |
| **S3 Glacier Deep Archive** | Long-term archival, retrieval in 12h+. |
| **S3 Outposts**       	| On-premises S3 storage. |

## ❓ Exam Practice Questions

### 🔹 Multiple Choice
**Q1.** Which of the following is required to enable Cross-Region Replication (CRR) on an S3 bucket?  
A. Encryption must be enabled.  
B. Versioning must be enabled.  
C. Bucket name must be globally unique.  
D. Object Lock must be enabled.

✅ **Answer: B**

---

**Q2.** You want to store data that is rarely accessed, must be retrieved in milliseconds, and should cost less than S3 Standard. Which storage class should you choose?  
A. S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval  
B. S3 Intelligent-Tiering  
C. S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval  
D. S3 Standard-IA

✅ **Answer: C**

---

**Q3.** An S3 bucket policy allows `Principal: *` with `Action: s3:GetObject`. What does this configuration mean?  
A. The bucket is private.  
B. The bucket objects are publicly readable.  
C. Only the bucket owner can read objects.  
D. Objects can only be accessed with signed URLs.

✅ **Answer: B**

---

### 🔹 True / False
**Q4.** S3 bucket names must be unique across all AWS Regions.  
✅ True

**Q5.** Replication in S3 works for both existing and new objects.  
❌ False (only new objects after enabling replication).

**Q6.** S3 One Zone-IA offers the same durability as Standard-IA.  
✅ True (11 9’s durability, but only stored in one AZ).

---

✅ **Exam Tip**: Expect scenario-based questions (e.g., "Which storage class is cheapest for archival with retrieval in 12 hours?"). Always pay attention to **keywords like cost, durability, retrieval time, and compliance**.
